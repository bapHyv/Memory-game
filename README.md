## Memory Game

I made this project with [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) to keep practicing hooks and context (seState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer).

### Dependencies:

-[ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
-[React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/quick-start)
-[React-Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/)
-[Howler](https://howlerjs.com/)
-[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


### How to play:

This is a **memory game**. Chose a **theme**, a **difficulty** and a **time** then you are good to go!<br />
The goal is to find every **matching card** from the board.

### Run the application:

To run this application, use the commande line `npm start`
